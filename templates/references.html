<!-- <h4> Datasets Used: </h4>

<b>OPUS:</b> Collection of translated texts from the web. Sources like JW300, GNOME, and Ubuntu are present here. <br>
<b>Opus-100:</b> English-Centric multilingual corpus including 100 languages. No preprocessing was needed here. <br>
<b>JW300:</b> Corpus for 300 languages based on religious texts. Good quality. Preprocessing needed. <br>
<b>OpenSubtitles:</b> Corresponds to translations for movie subtitles. Small sentences but good vocabulary. Preprocessing done. After the threshold preprocessing, the size got very less (used the value of 0.6 here). So the threshold values won't be used here. <br>
<b>Wikimatrix:</b> Corresponds to the parallel corpora mined from Wikimedia by Facebook research. Not many Indian language pairs are present in it though.The data aligned with English is comparable in size to JW300. But for other inter-indic pairs, the amount of data is very less <br>
<b>KDE4:</b> Parallel corpus of the KDE4 localization files. Contains decent amount of text in some Indic language pairs.  <br>
<b>Tanzil:</b> Another corpus based on religious text. This one being specific to Quran translations. A lot of data between Hi, Ur, En. <br>
